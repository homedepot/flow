### CF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry)
Performs a zero-downtime deployment to cloud foundry expecting a manifest named after your environment (e.g. development.manifest.yml). The version for the deployed application defaults to the latest release in GitHub but can be overwritten with the `-v` or `--version` flag. This currently (12-07-16) requires an artifact in artifactory to function.

**Actions:**

deploy - push application to Pivotal Cloud Foundry

**Usage:** `flow cf [Flags] [Action] [Environment]`

**Flags:**

-v VERSION, --version VERSION (optional) Defaults to latest version.  If deployment is for a previous version, pass in the version number here.

-f FORCE, --force FORCE (optional) Force the deploy even if the same version number is already running. Note: Zero-downtime deployment will not occur if forcing a deploy on the same version number.

-s SCRIPT, --script SCRIPT (optional) If you choose to use a custom deploy script instead of the default zero-downtime, pass in the path to deploy script here.

-metrics MANIFEST, --manifest MANIFEST (optional) Custom manifest name if you choose not to  follow standard pattern of{environment}.manifest.yml

**Environment Variables:**

GITHUB_TOKEN (Required) for access to your project API _NOTE: Requires repo access only._

ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN (Required) api token to artifactory OR encrypted password for user if used in conjunction with ARTIFACTORY_USER (api token is preferred over password)

DEPLOYMENT_USER (Required) for logging into PCF

DEPLOYMENT_PWD (Required) for logging into PCF

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL (optional) for sending error messages from Flow to your slack channel

ARTIFACTORY_USER (optional) user for uploading to artifactory

CF_BUILDPACK (optional)  Custom build packs should typically be indicated in your manifest; however, sometimes URLs for build packs may contains sensitive information, such as a github oauth token.  You can use this environment variable to avoid exposing this in your manifest.

**Settings.ini (Global Settings):**

cli_download_path (required) path to download cf cli


For the help documentation, please check `flow cf -h`


### Google Cloud App Engine

This currently (12-07-16) requires an artifact in artifactory to function.

**Actions:**

deploy - ship version of code to Google Cloud App Engine

**Usage:** `flow gcappengine [Flags] [Action] [Environment]`

**Flags:**

-v VERSION, --version VERSION (optional) Defaults to latest version.  If deployment is for a previous version, pass in the version number here.
